  	<h1>TERMS OF SERVICE/INFO</h1>

	<div class="agree">
	<h3>by commissioning me, you agree to my terms of service!!!</h3>
	</div>
	
	<div class="welcomebelowtext">
		
	<h1>GENERAL</h1>
		<li>ALL commissions (besides reference sheets) require proper visual reference. </li>
		<li>Prices may go up depending on complexity of character or additional requests.</li>
		<li>Once a commission is completed and approved, I will not make any changes unless it was a mistake from me. (within 24hrs)</li>
		<li>I will post most commissions. If you would like to not be tagged in a post, please let me know. </li>
		<li>I have the right to decline a commission for any reason.</li>
		<li>Clients may not use my art for commercial use/profit (advertisements, stickers, shirts) without permission.</li>
		<li>Clients must be at least 14 years old.</li>
		<li>Please be able to communicate! As long as you can message me within a day or two. Your commission may go on hold/be canceled depending on how unresponsive you are.</li>
	</div>
	
<div class="welcomebelowtext">
	<h1>PAYMENT</h1>
		<li>All payments are done via Paypal</li>
		<li>No favors/game currency</li>
		<li>Payments may be split with another person(s) (taxes/fees will be heavier)</li>
		<li>There is a 2 USD tax on every commission to cover Paypal taxes and transfer fees.</li>
		<li>I take payment after the sketch is approved. </li>
</div>
	
<div class="welcomebelowtext">
	<h1>CANCELLATION AND REFUNDS</h1>
		<li>I have the right to cancel any commission at anytime. (ex: If client is harassing me/change their mind after agreeing to the sketch/ask for WIP shots three+ times a day.)</li>
		<li>If a client wishes to cancel a commission after payment and progress, they will be partially refunded depending on how much work as been done. I decide how much is refunded.</li>
		<li>No refunds under any circumstance after commission completion.</li>
</div>
	
<div class="welcomebelowtext">
	<h1>ADDITIONAL COMMISSION INFO</h1>
  <li>Simple props are free (may be extra due to complexity)</li>
		<li>You do not have to ask for WIP shots, they will be sent automatically when significant progress is made on your commission. </li>
		<li>Commissions will come with two versions, transparent and one with a simple background. (unless a specific background is commissioned)</li>
		<li>Telling me what pose or facial expression you want would help out a lot!</li>
		<li>I DO NOT have a refined wait time, but typically complete commissions within a month. Please remember this.</li>
		<li>I will draw: blood, candy gore, wings, pokemon, and protogens.</li>
		<li>I will not draw: humans, extreme gore, NSFW, ponies, mecha, most feral ocs, company mascots, or sergals/structurally similar creatures.</li>
